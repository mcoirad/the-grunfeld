Can you believe that are probably 100 schools out there offering degrees in sports management and analytics and the like? Meanwhile the guy who sort of helped invent this gig is still around. Most NBA players peak at some point during their actual playing careers. He might be nearly 80 but he forged the latest version of Miami Heat contender out of just Jimmy Butler, hand me downs from Goodwill, and some Florida sunshine.

More seriously the Riley's Miami Heat shown a knack for getting the most out of the players they bring in, wherever they come from. While not every decision in free agency has been optimal, and the failure to bring in a star while allowing key departures this off-season is glaring, Riley has done enough both over his career and in this Jimmy Butler era to deserve his spot on this list. Even considering Miami the city does by itself.
