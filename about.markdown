### **Hello!** 

This site was made by a long suffering Wizards fan. By "long" I mean my entire life. Well... I mean the Gilbert Arena years were fun. And John Wall and Co. did win 49 games, once. But really, Jan Vesely? There were so many years of squandered picks, draft capital, and just very mediocre management. Thus the creation of *"The Grunfeld,"* a site that aims to highlight poor performance of NBA higher-ups.

It is well-known that we track and quantify the performance of players, their bodies, and their athletic feats with countless statistics, perhaps overly so. It is only fair that we put the same effort into tracking the performance of managers. At the end they are the ones that should be held the most accountable by fanbases. Certainly, reducing the someone's performance down to a single number will miss some things. But that is the point. **Here we use the stats that we can find to create our own new abstracted system of hierarchy.** In case counting wins wasn't good enough.

And hey, for any NBA owner reading this: I will work for half of what any NBA GM makes, and can guarantee you I won't take Jan Vesely!

### Our core ranking methodology is pretty simple:

1. We build a database of transactions: trades, draft picks, free agency signings (TODO: departures)
2. We calculate the value of a transaction with a player's BPM * minutes played for their contract with team
3. We sum up the value of all the rankings over the time of an executive's tenure
4. ???
5. PROFIT
